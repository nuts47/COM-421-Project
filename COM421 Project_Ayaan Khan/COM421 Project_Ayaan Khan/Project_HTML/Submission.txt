short self-critique:
In developing the "Research Paper Toolbox" HTML page, I aimed to create an educational resource that was both informative and user-friendly. My approach focused on a clean layout and intuitive navigation to ensure that users could easily find and access the various sections of the site.
Reflecting on the project, I believe that with more time, I would make the color contrast a bit better and I would go deeper into accessibility features. This would include implementing a responsive design for better mobile accessibility and adding keyboard navigation to accommodate users with different needs.
